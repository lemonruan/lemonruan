		<h2>Gaming History</h2>
		<p>
			For a time I was addicted to Video games, or I would rather put it as escaping from the real world into the digital world. I even wrote a whole seven-page 
			essay about it (Check it out in my <a href="https://stonybrook.digication.com/limeng_ruan/Essay_three/published" target="_blank">e-portfolio</a> if interested) . 
			Now that I have thought about it more, my opinion is once again a little different. But hey, who has the right to judge such things. Video games, just like everything 
			else, has its upsides and downsides. It's up to the players. There are Gourmets and there are gluttons. I, as a player and a semi-professional developer view games as 
			simply products, just like other softwares.
		</p>

		<h2>More about thoughts on Games</h2>
		<p>
			As a male game player, I can't help but notice that many video games design their female characters to be very 
			sexy and attractive. For example, Devil May Cry, a game series that I love feature their main female characters to be extremely hot, and it was enjoyable in an approriate way. However, some games over use that element. For example, I don't enjoy playing GTA (Grand Theft Auto), and one of the reasons is that the game makes females look so "bad".

		<h2>What I Play</h2>
			<h4><a name="dota" id="name-link">Dota 2</a></h4>
			<p>Probably the game I played the most. Why do almost everyone else I know play League of Legends? I have no idea.
				<br><br>
				Dota 1 was originally a map that run on Warcraft III Frozen Throne, a game I love as well. Dota 1 was published in 2003. Then League of Legends came out 
				in 2009, so in a way League of Legends copied Dota (In my opinion as a Dota player, well, maybe a little, after I play League of 
				Legends a few time, I realized that it's very different from Dota. Same type of game, very different champions settings and map settings 
				resulted in drastically different ways of playing). 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4><a name="wow" id="name-link">World of Warcraft</a></h4>
			<p>
				I haven't played this game for months now because it really was time consuming, but it was one of the best the games I ever played. The best 
				MMORPG(Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) I have played. <br><br>
				Characters: Competitive PVP Warrior, Mage and Death Knight.<br><br>
				Add me on Battle.Net! My Name: <u>GiantDwarf#13698</u>
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4><a name="war3" id="name-link">Warcraft III Frozen Throne</a></h4>
			<p>
				This game represents my childhood. I still play this game a couple times a week. Just classic, the best strategy game with the best story background 
				for a game. No additional explanation needed.<br><br>
				Favourite Race: Orc.
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h4>Other games</h4>
			<p>
				Overwatch, PUBG, League of Legends, Minecraft, Hearthstone, and lots of single-player games.
