				<h2> Learning is a process</h2>
					<p>
					To be honest, I don't have a very long history of coding.
					<br>
					<br>
					I had some attempts at learning to program at high school, I would watch some YouTube videos and 
					try writing some small programs. But I never really learned much. Heck, I didn't even know which 
					language I should start with. I tried C and Java, but I stopped after 2 weeks. I had no motivation, 
					nor any goal in programming. However, I still liked the thinking and problem solving when I tried it, 
					so I selected Computer Science as my major. Then I got really good with Java, but I was limited to 
					Java. Sometimes I got Stack Overflow, and I would write crazy recursive functions because I had no
					knowledge in memory management.
					<br><br>
					Better late than never, I realized that being a computer science is very different from other majors. 
					Classes are important, but because of the rapid rate of improvement in technology, the more important
					are new information and knowledge that I need to learn by myself just like the other professional 
					programmers. Knowing things are good for working on a project, but it is even better to be able to 
					learn and adapt to new knowledge quickly.
					<br><br>
					I am not yet a can-do-it-all programmer, but by receiving a large amount of information daily, I am in 
					the process of becoming one.
					</p>
				
				<h2> As a Java Programmer </h2>
				<p>				
					Throughout the courses in freshmen year, I have been trained to code in Java with high efficiency.
					<br><br>
					Some highlights in Java Programming is mentioned in my resume.

				<p>
					As mentioned in my resume, in a software engineering course I took last summer, I designed and coded a 
					JavaFX based game, it utilizes MVC(Model-View-Control) pattern, dividing tasks into 2 dozens of classes 
					in different packages.<br>
					This is the my design of this project.
