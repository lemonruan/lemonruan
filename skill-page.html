				<h2> Learning is a process</h2>
					<p>
					To be honest, I don't have a very long history of coding.
					<br>
					<br>
					I had some attempts at learning to program at high school, I would watch some YouTube videos and 
					try writing some small programs. But I never really learned much. Heck, I didn't even know which 
					language I should start with. I tried C and Java, but I stopped after 2 weeks. I had no motivation, 
					nor any goal in programming. However, I still liked the thinking and problem solving when I tried it, 
					so I selected Computer Science as my major. Then I got really good with Java, but I was limited to 
					Java. Sometimes I got Stack Overflow, and I would write crazy recursive functions because I had no
					knowledge in memory management.
					<br><br>
					Better late than never, I realized that being a computer science is very different from other majors. 
					Classes are important, but because of the rapid rate of improvement in technology, the more important
					are new information and knowledge that I need to learn by myself just like the other professional 
					programmers. Knowing things are good for working on a project, but it is even better to be able to 
					learn and adapt to new knowledge quickly.
					<br><br>
					I am not yet a can-do-it-all programmer, but by receiving a large amount of information daily, I am in 
					the process of becoming one.
					</p>
				<br><br>
				
				<h4> <a name="java" id="name-link">As a Java Programmer</a> </h4>
				<p>				
					Throughout the courses in freshmen year, I have been trained to code in Java with high efficiency.
					<br><br>
					Some highlights in Java Programming is mentioned in my <a href="files/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					As mentioned in my resume, in a software engineering course I took last summer, I designed and coded a 
					JavaFX based game, it utilizes MVC(Model-View-Control) pattern, dividing tasks into 2 dozens of classes 
					in different packages.<br>
					This is the my design of this project.
					
				</p>
				<section id="downloads" class="clearfix">
						<a href="files/game-design.pdf" id="resume" class="button" target="_blank"><span>GameDesign</span></a>
				</section>
				<p>
					And you can check out my code here in one of my repositories: 
					<a href="https://lemon_ruan@bitbucket.org/lemon_ruan/regiovinco_implementationstageii.git" target="_blank">Bit bucket</a>.
				</p>
				
				<h4> More than Java </h4>
				<p>
					While having Java as my first language in computer science, I am currently learning C++ (very similar to Java), 
					html and JavaScript for Web Design (Well, you can tell I'm not a great web designer, at least not yet), and MIPS 
					for low level assembly stuff.
				</p>
				<br><br><br>
				
				<h2> Some skills in modelling </h2>
				<p>
					This is one of the things I used to do in high school when I got bored.
					I haven't given much thought about it, but looking back, I actually do have quite a few skills in 2D and 3D modelling.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4> <a name="3dmax" id="name-link">3ds Max</a></h4>
				<p>
					This is the first 3D modelling tool I learned. I started with making some simple furnitures, some fruits, animal shapes. 
					And I got pretty good at making things with basically just lines, starting from scratch.
				</p>

				<br><br><br>
	
				<h4><a name="zbrush" id="name-link">Zbrush</a></h4>
				<p>
					However, I then discovered this tool that enables me to make smooth shapes like playing with clays. It saves much time 
					comparing to making stuff out of lines. However, just like in programming, programs of lower level languages are usually 
					faster than of high level languages, the models made with Zbrush can be larger files, with more unnecessary lines and can
					slow things down a lot. But that can be optimized later.
				</p>

				<br><br>
				
				<h4><a name="photoshop" id="name-link">PhotoShop</a></h4>
				<p>
					Well, those models above look really out of colour, don't they? That's why I also learned some skills in PhotoShop to give 
					my models some "skins", but I never got really good at that; I got rather pretty good at editing pictures.
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<h4>AutoCad, UDK, etc.</h4>
				<p>
					Well, Like I said, I try to learn a lot stuff. I am especially good at some, but not limited to them.
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<h4>A little fun in real life modelling</h4>
				<p>
					What do you do when you go to a beach with friends and you can't swim(Actually I can, I'm just not really good) ?
				</p>
				<h5>You do more modelling! With sand!!!</h5>
