					<h4> As a C++ Programmer </h4>
				<p>
					No matter what language, you know I will make games with it. And C++ is so much more suitable for Games 
					than Java obviously. I actually learned most of my knowledge in C++ through game programming.
					<br><br>
					Something I am proud of is the game I made during April 2016 called Dismember. It is a 2D side scroller game with unique features of the characters head and arms being breakable. The whole game uses Box2D to 
					simulate all the physics actions and determines whether the if the player will lose an arm or head.
					<br><br>
					This game won the Stony Brook University's Annual Game Programming Competition on May 13th, 2016.
					<br>
					Currently this is still a demo completed in 3 weeks. And it uses a game Engine that I partially wrote. This game engine though is very minimum and does not utilize many advantages C++ can have. This is why
					this game is under redesign for more interesting features and under research for a suitable mature game
					engine. Currently Unity 2D is the prefered option. Well, I need to learn it first, eh? And also more
					knowledge in multiplayer options for the game. Internet programming and that sort of stuff.
					<br><br>
					This is just a DEMO that only took about weeks in rush for participating the game programming comptition.
					So the quality of the game especially graphically seems "boring". Here is the link to a peek at it.

				<h4>Unreal Engine</h4>
				<p>
					<h5>Dismember Remake<h5>
					Since People liked it, so why not turn it into something publishable, eh?
					<br>
					Well, I tried. Unreal Engine was selected because it has already got really awesome networking API and we intended to make this a online 
					multiplayer game. At the same time, Unreal Engine is also known for good performance, which is another thing we need because imagining the physics 
					going on in the game, it would require some really good memory allocation and cache utilization, etc.
					<br>
					The process is less pleasant. First of all, Unreal Engine has only 3D physics. The 2D physics is deprecated. But we didn't give it too much 
					testing, thinking that the 3D physics will work just fine. Well we were terribly wrong. There are countless issues with 3D physics used on 2D. 
					For instance, objects will get stuck in each other if a certain amount of force is applied. Not sure about the reason, but my guess is that Unreal 
					has some compromisation when a large force is applied.
					<br>
					<br>
					</p>
					<h2><a name="physics Simulation" id="name-link"></a> Cross-network Physics Simulation</h2>
					<br>
					<p>
					Most of the problems are with physics. Another one would be trying to sync the physics between server and client. This is the most tricky. First of all, 
					unlike an usual object that has replicated movements, objects connected by a joint will require some tricky way of getting it to work. Because a function that 
					connects the 2 objects cannot be replicated, but need to be called on client to make that joint. Now the problem is that an object cannot be directly passed from server 
					to client, or vice versa. Because they are really just addresses, and on 2 different machines, those are different. That means the server can only let the client know 
					what to connect by passing some primitive variables. The way I got it to work is sorting all objects once on server, then once on client so that I can pass the index and 
					client can find the object in the sorted array based on index. Another problem is, everything dynamically created is not referencible by the client. I am not sure the reason, 
					but through testing, it seemed to be the way Unreal Engine works. That limited us to only be able to "create" things by putting it in the level at compile time.
					<br>
					<br>
					Even with all of that working, there rises another problem with networking. There are always latencies. And that would mean the client will be connecting 2 objects at the 
					wrong position because by the time it receives the instruction to do that, the server has already connected them at different locations. The larger the latency, the more errors 
					there are. This can be solved by also sending the positions of the objects to be connected, or relative positions. There will still be errors, but it probably is as good as it could get.
					<br>
					<br>
					Now someone might be wondering, why exactly am I trying to do this with physics on on both server and client? Shouldn't server be the only one handling physics? Well, that would be 
					too bloody expensive considering all the physics going on. Also, I don't think Unreal even allows that. The way Unreal Engine's cross network physics works is: simulate on both server and 
					client. Only update the positions of the objects that a player affected. If players are not moving, not causing any physics interaction. There is simply no data from server to client about 
					updating movements of physics simulated objects. Everything is simulated separately on both machines.
					<br>
					<br>
					Anyway, the development of this game faces so many challenges, and yes, it was a terrible idea using Unreal for this game. Unreal is an amazing Engine, and I will use it in the future, but only with 
					the suitable kind of game.

				<br><br>
				
				<h4> As a Java Programmer</h4>
				<p>				
					Throughout the courses in freshmen and sophmore year, I have been trained to code in Java with high efficiency.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					This RegioVinco Game is the very first "big sized" program I wrote. Well it is a game! Just what I like.
					It is for a course that teaches mainly Java.<br>
					This is the my design of this project.
					
				</p>
				<section id="downloads" class="clearfix">
						<a href="files/game-design.pdf" id="resume" class="button" target="_blank"><span>GameDesign</span></a>
				</section>
				<p>
					And you can check out my code here in one of my repositories: 
					<a href="https://lemon_ruan@bitbucket.org/lemon_ruan/regiovinco_implementationstageii.git" target="_blank">Bit bucket</a>.
					(Note: Go to RegioVinco Folder for the complete verison. The src/regiovinco was a test version created in first commit. It won't run the .jar with just jre. You need NetBeans to run it. I know, that seems incomplete. But making it runnable with simply jre requires a lot of recoding. And this isn't really worth the effort.)
				</p>
				<p>
					What helped me even more is that I later became a Teaching Assitant for this course mutiple times. And I was
					able to not only helpe others but also able to learn much myself. This is indeed one of my favorite courses
					in College. Each semester the Professor teaches the same concepts but asks to students to make different 
					projects that involves different libraris and sometimes new Languages for some part. (i.e. HTML, JavaScript)
					I was required to learn as the students learn and then guide them and teach them immediately. Those were
					very fruitful experiences not only for my knowledge, but also in my spirit because I know that I helped
					others a lot.
				</p>
						
				<h4>A Java project with more work</h4>
				
				<p>This one is, well, sadly not a game. It is a music website, much like spotify. And it is made 
						with Java as the backend coding language with Spring and Hibernate. And front end 
						uses Html, Javascript, Css, the usual Web Development stuff. This project gave me 
						a lot of insight into networking and servers. And even though it is not a game project, 
						it's one of the projects that I have spent most hours on. Probably in the 400 to 500 hours 
						range.</p>
						
				<p>And here is the link to that project, <a href="https://github.com/YizhiYang/Spotify">link</a></p>

				<h2> Some skills in modelling </h2>
				<p>
					This is one of the things I used to do in high school when I got bored.
					I haven't given much thought about it, but looking back, I actually do have quite a few skills in and 3D modelling.
				</p>
				<h2><a name="3dmax" id="name-link"></a><h2>
				<br>
				<h4> 3ds Max</h4>
				<p>
					This is the first 3D modelling tool I learned. I started with making some simple furnitures, some fruits, animal shapes. 
					And I got pretty good at making things with basically just lines, starting from scratch.

				<br><br>
	
				<h4>Zbrush</h4>
				<p>
					However, I then discovered this tool that enables me to make smooth shapes like playing with clays. It saves much time 
					comparing to making stuff out of lines. However, just like in programming, programs of lower level languages are usually 
					faster than of high level languages, the models made with Zbrush can be larger files, with more unnecessary lines and can
					slow things down a lot. But that can be optimized later.

					<h5>Tech Wars<h5>
					A game project by myself and a partner. An RTS game that instead of combats and killings, it is played through selling people technological products, such as cell phone and laptop. So, A peaceful RTS game.
					<br>
					Reponsible for all the coding in the game. This is a playable demo, please use 1366*768 resolution to play the game. There are definitely many flaws with it as it is only a demo. And whether it will be further updated or remade is based on other people's reviews on whether this game idea has any potential.
