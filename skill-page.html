				<h2> Learning is a process</h2>
					<p>
					To be honest, I don't have a very long history of coding.
					<br>
					<br>
					I had some attempts at learning to program at high school, I would watch some YouTube videos and 
					try writing some small programs. But I never really learned much. Heck, I didn't even know which 
					language I should start with. Probably beacause all I thought of programming was that it was cool,
					and did not really know what to do with it even if I did learn to program. And sometimes when the
					goal is set too high, I felt discouraged. I guess that's why people go to colleges instead of learning
					everything from online. Guidance is necessary before one can fly freely. However, even college classes
					are not enough really for a computer science student.
					<br><br>
					I realized that computer science is very different from other majors. 
					Classes are important, but because of the rapid rate of improvement in technology, the more important
					are new information and knowledge that I need to learn by myself just like the other professional 
					programmers. Knowing things before-hand are good for working on a project, but it is even better to be able to 
					learn and adapt to new knowledge quickly.
					<br><br>
					</p>
					<h2><a name="C++" id="name-link"></a><h2>
				<br><br>
					<h4> As a C++ Programmer </h4>
				<p>
					No matter what language, you know I will make games with it. And C++ is so much more suitable for Games 
					than Java obviously. I actually learned most of my knowledge in C++ through game programming.
					<br><br>
					Something I am proud of is the game I made during April 2016 called Dismember. It is a 2D side scroller game with unique features of the characters head and arms being breakable. The whole game uses Box2D to 
					simulate all the physics actions and determines whether the if the player will lose an arm or head.
					<br><br>
					This game won the Stony Brook University's Annual Game Programming Competition on May 13th, 2016.
					<br>
					Currently this is still a demo completed in 3 weeks. And it uses a game Engine that I partially wrote. This game engine though is very minimum and does not utilize many advantages C++ can have. This is why
					this game is under redesign for more interesting features and under research for a suitable mature game
					engine. Currently Unity 2D is the prefered option. Well, I need to learn it first, eh? And also more
					knowledge in multiplayer options for the game. Internet programming and that sort of stuff.
					<br><br>
					This is just a DEMO that only took about weeks in rush for participating the game programming comptition.
					So the quality of the game especially graphically seems "boring". Here is the link to a peek at it.
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZIkzF8FuRE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZIkzF8FuRE</a>
					<br>
					The projected release of the re-made game will be in May 2017!!!

				<h4> As a Java Programmer</h4>
				<p>				
					Throughout the courses in freshmen and sophmore year, I have been trained to code in Java with high efficiency.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					This RegioVinco Game is the very first "big sized" program I wrote. Well it is a game! Just what I like.
					It is for a course that teaches mainly Java.<br>
					This is the my design of this project.
					
				</p>
				<section id="downloads" class="clearfix">
						<a href="files/game-design.pdf" id="resume" class="button" target="_blank"><span>GameDesign</span></a>
				</section>
				<p>
					And you can check out my code here in one of my repositories: 
					<a href="https://lemon_ruan@bitbucket.org/lemon_ruan/regiovinco_implementationstageii.git" target="_blank">Bit bucket</a>.
					(Note: Go to RegioVinco Folder for the complete verison. The src/regiovinco was a test version created in first commit. It won't run the .jar with just jre. You need NetBeans to run it. I know, that seems incomplete. But making it runnable with simply jre requires a lot of recoding. And this isn't really worth the effort.)
				</p>
				<p>
					What helped me even more is that I later became a Teaching Assitant for this course mutiple times. And I was
					able to not only helpe others but also able to learn much myself. This is indeed one of my favorite courses
					in College. Each semester the Professor teaches the same concepts but asks to students to make different 
					projects that involves different libraris and sometimes new Languages for some part. (i.e. HTML, JavaScript)
					I was required to learn as the students learn and then guide them and teach them immediately. Those were
					very fruitful experiences not only for my knowledge, but also in my spirit because I know that I helped
					others a lot.

				<h2> Some skills in modelling </h2>
				<p>
					This is one of the things I used to do in high school when I got bored.
					I haven't given much thought about it, but looking back, I actually do have quite a few skills in and 3D modelling.
				</p>
				<h2><a name="3dmax" id="name-link"></a><h2>
				<br>
				<h4> 3ds Max</h4>
				<p>
					This is the first 3D modelling tool I learned. I started with making some simple furnitures, some fruits, animal shapes. 
					And I got pretty good at making things with basically just lines, starting from scratch.
				</p>

				<br><br>
	
				<h4>Zbrush</h4>
				<p>
					However, I then discovered this tool that enables me to make smooth shapes like playing with clays. It saves much time 
					comparing to making stuff out of lines. However, just like in programming, programs of lower level languages are usually 
					faster than of high level languages, the models made with Zbrush can be larger files, with more unnecessary lines and can
					slow things down a lot. But that can be optimized later.
				</p>

				<h2><a name="unity" id="name-link"></a><h2>
				<br><br>
				
				<h4>Unity and Blender</h4>
				<p>
					And of course, Unity is now my focus. Wish me luck on potentially my first published game in the future!~~~
